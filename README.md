    image: ghcr.io/lps-rocks/recordurbate-server:latest
    volumes:
      - ./downloads:/app/videos
      - ./configs:/app/configs
    ports:
      - 5599:5599
    #you can define user but you need to create mount volumes before with correct rights
    #user: '1000:1000'

For ARM (Raspberry Pi), you can build your own :

```yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: https://github.com/gallofeliz/recordurbate-server.git
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

## UI

You can design your own UI for that, or use curl, postman.
